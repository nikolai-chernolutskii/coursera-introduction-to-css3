### Steps
1. Create a file called hw1.css and save it in your css folder.
2. Follow the instructions to see which elements you should style.   BE SURE TO USE GOOD PRACTICES, for instance, using hex or rgb, not color names.
3. Submit your css file.  (If you used CodePen to create your code, save a copy in a file called hw1.css.)
4. Use the peer grader to assess the work of your fellow students.


### Rules

* Do not modify HTML
* Create a style sheet that updates header, headings, section, links and images
    * Header
        * Change background color
    * H1, H2
        * Change the font color
        * Make sure the heading is displayed in all capital letters
        * For just H1 - center the text
    * Section
        * Change the background color
    * Links
        * Change the background color and font color
    * Images
        * Use __CSS3__ to remove images from the page

### Peer grading
* Grades will be based on the level of completion, not aesthetics
* Apply proper standards
* Style only the listed elements (otherwise it makes it harder to grade the assignment)

## Week 2 Assignment

### Objectives

1. Create a style sheet and link it to the html files.  (Without changing the html.)
2. Style the sheet using the properties we covered in lecture.
3. Consider using some elements we didn’t cover, or didn’t cover well.  You can search for the options online, or you can watch the videos from Week Four for some pointers.

### Getting started:
You will use the same code as you used for Assignment One.  I would recommend that you save a copy of your stylesheet for backup.  The html is all still the same.

### Steps*:
1. Download the image from [here](http://intro-webdesign.com/CSS/assignment-2/images/flywheel.jpg) and put it into a folder named images.
2. Style the following:
   * The body should have padding and margin
      * You can also adjust the size of the text, but this is not required
   * The header should have a background color, background image (using a local image), and padding
   * H1
      * Change the font color
      * Increase the font size
   * The navigation links (and only the links in the navigation) should be styled with a new display, margin, border-radius, text-decoration (*remove the underline*), and padding
   * The link to the current page should be styled differently from the other links (using class = "active"). *Use the background color and font color*
   * The .left and .right classes should be next to each other, not one on top of the other.
   * *Change the background color for the left class*
   * The images should be part of the page now.  In addition, they should have a border, be centered horizontally, and have vertical (top/bottom) space between them and the other images.

**Italicized instructoins are taken from the course video (see the link below)*

### Submission
1. Submit your css file, we will still call it hw1.css.
2. Use the peer grader to assess the work of your fellow students.  This second assignment may have a number of different options.  You can grade the assignment by eye, or else save the css and try applying it to the html files.

## Week 4 Assignment

### Objectives

1. Create a style sheet and link it to the html files.  (Without changing the html.)
2. Style the sheet using the properties we covered in lecture.  There is a particular emphasis on pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes.  There is an opportunity to use some properties we didn’t cover in class.  For instance, we want to style on the first element of each row to be left-aligned.  The rest should be centered.

### Getting started:
You will use the same code as you used for Assignment Two.  I would recommend that you save a copy of your stylesheet for backup.  The html is all still the same.

### Steps*:

#### Style the following:
* The table should be styled using at least four  properties
   * *Font - multiple families, size, weight and line-height*
   * *Width - don't take up the entire space*
   * *Margin - center the table*
* The table headings should have a thicker bottom border with the top two corners rounded, a background color *(try to use a gradient, you will need some browser prefixes)*, and at least one other property
* Style the table so that the text in the first column is left-aligned and the text in the other two columns is centered
* Set the opacity of the table rows to a value between .6 and .8 (make sure it is still visible)
* Change the opacity of a row when it is hovered over
* The table elements <td> should be styled using at least four  properties *(In the video the instructions are to style the padding, the font color, the background color and set the border radius to 2px). Optional: use text-shadow*

**Italicized instructoins are taken from the course video (see the link below)*

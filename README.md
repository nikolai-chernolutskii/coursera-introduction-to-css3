### Steps
1. Create a file called hw1.css and save it in your css folder.
2. Follow the instructions to see which elements you should style.   BE SURE TO USE GOOD PRACTICES, for instance, using hex or rgb, not color names.
3. Submit your css file.  (If you used CodePen to create your code, save a copy in a file called hw1.css.)
4. Use the peer grader to assess the work of your fellow students.


### Rules

* Do not modify HTML
* Create a style sheet that updates header, headings, section, links and images
    * Header
        * Change background color
    * H1, H2
        * Change the font color
        * Make sure the heading is displayed in all capital letters
        * For just H1 - center the text
    * Section
        Change the background color
    * Links
        * Change the background color and font color
    * Images
        * Use __CSS3__ to remove images from the page

### Peer grading
* Grades will be based on the level of completion, not aesthetics
* Apply proper standards
* Style only the listed elements (otherwise it makes it harder to grade the assignment)
